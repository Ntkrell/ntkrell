## Hello! üëãüèΩ

My name is Natasha (she/her/hers) and I am a human-environment geographer. I study the impacts of climate variability on small-scale farming and the diffusion of mobile phones and access to digital information. I recieved my Ph.D. in geography from the University of California, Santa Barbara in 2021. My research is centered in Eastern and Southern Africa.  

If you like reading about climate + crops + people, check out these recent publications:
- [Consequences of dryland maize planting decisions under increased seasonal rainfall variability](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2020WR029362) in Water Resources Research (& check out our model in [this github repo](https://github.com/ecohydro/maize-Toff)). 
- [Using real-time mobile phone data to characterize the relationships between small-scale farmers‚Äô planting dates and socio-environmental factors](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212096322000031) in Climate Risk Management.
- [Smallholder farmers' use of mobile phone services in Kenya](https://rsa.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17565529.2020.1748847), which is also mentioned in the Agrilinks blog post, ["Why women aren't using your app"](https://www.agrilinks.org/post/why-women-arent-using-your-ag-app). 

- In my career, I'm interested in closing the gap between individuals on the front lines of climate change and the dissemination of real-time information, alerts, and climate services. If these topics interest you, don't hesitate to reach out!
