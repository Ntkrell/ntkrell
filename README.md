## Hello! üëãüèΩ

My name is Natasha (she/her/hers) and I am a PhD candidate in geography at the University of California, Santa Barbara. I'm in my 5th year in Dr. Kelly Caylor's [Water, Vegetation and Society](http://caylor.eri.ucsb.edu/) lab.

I am a human-environment geographer who studies the impacts of climate variability on farming and I also study the diffusion of mobile phones and access to digital information. My research is centered in Eastern and Southern Africa.  You can read my recent publication on [smallholder farmers' use of mobile phone services in Kenya](https://rsa.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17565529.2020.1748847), which is also mentioned in the Agrilinks blog post, ["Why women aren't using your app"](https://www.agrilinks.org/post/why-women-arent-using-your-ag-app). In my career, I'm interested in closing the gap between individuals on the front lines of climate change and the dissemination of real-time information, alerts, and climate services. If these topics interest you, don't hesitate to reach out!
